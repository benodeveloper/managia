# Managia Project

## Overview

Managia is a project aimed at learning Django by recreating a previous project called Gestancia. Gestancia is a truck wrecker task management application that was originally developed for a client using PHP.

## Purpose

The purpose of Managia is to gain practical experience with Django framework concepts and features by implementing them in a real-world project scenario. By recreating Gestancia using Django, I aim to deepen my understanding of web development, particularly in the context of task management applications.
